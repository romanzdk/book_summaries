Topic: Personal development

- in order to read faster we have to:
    - stop **vocalization** (reading out “loud” (move lips))
    - stop **regression** reading (going back to the text we just read)
    - enlarge our **perspective vision span** (read more words at once)
    - build up our **dictionary** (the more words we know, the quicker we read them)
    - read **aggressively** - explicitly wanting to read quickly
- we read faster when reading in **columns** (newspapers-like format)
- speed-reader **comprehends** better than a normal reader because she is utilizing her short-term memory better (meaning of the sentence vs. meaning of the word)
- **pacer** is good for beginner speed-reader, but should be abandoned later as it acts as a distractor for the brain
- randomising letters in the middle of words had little or no effect on the ability of skilled readers to understand the text
- exercises:
    - read in columns (newspapers/bible-like or draw vertical lines in the book)
    - read small chunks of text at one glance and increase them over time
    - focus on one thing in front of you (pencil, finger..); try to see other things in the “background”; try to perceive as much details as possible of the object in the background while still focusing on the pencil/finger
    - start reading line one word from the beginning and read through the last word on the line - let peripheral vision see the very first and the very last word

- how to measure:
    - **WPM** - word per minute
    - **ERR** - effective reading rate (WPM * comprehension percentage score)
